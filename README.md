# Rune-Caster
A VR spellcasting game where players wield magic by drawing ancient runes. The runecaster is a manipulator of powerful magic that takes the form of runesâ€”written sigils which serve as containers for magic energies. Runes existed before the first languages were created, and are a form of writing reality-changing energy.
